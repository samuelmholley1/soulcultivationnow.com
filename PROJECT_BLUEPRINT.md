# Soul Cultivation - Project Blueprint & Planning
## Master Business Blueprint | Source of Truth | Final Version

**Domain:** soulcultivationnow.com  
**Client:** Scott Sherman ("The Mendocino Alchemist")  
**Mission:** Transition from manual labor to passive income ecosystem by digitizing shamanic wisdom

---

## EXTERNAL TEAM INSTRUCTIONS (INTEGRATED WITH GOLD NUGGETS)

### The "Soul Cultivation" Master Business Blueprint
**Client:** Scott Sherman  
**Project:** Brand Reinvention & Passive Income Ecosystem

#### 1. Executive Summary & Brand Identity

Scott Sherman is a "Mendocino Alchemist"—a unique blend of a Master's level Social Worker/Sociologist and a classically trained Shaman (Blue Heron lineage, Dagara cosmology). He is transitioning from manual labor/trading time for money ($25/hr) to a passive income model using AI to capture his life's work.

**The Core Philosophy:**
- **The Motto:** "We can't not become enlightened; it is our destiny path. We might as well embrace it."
- **The Problem:** People are "stuck" due to friction between their Three Brains (Head, Heart, Gut).
- **The Solution:** "Soul Cultivation"—moving from trauma to flow using ancient wisdom and modern reframing.

**The "Trail Guide" Coaching Model (The Flicker)** ⭐ GOLD NUGGET #2
> **Critically distinct from a "Sherpa" model.**

Scott does NOT carry clients up the mountain (Sherpa). Like the Flicker (bird), he flies ahead to scout the terrain, lands, waits for the client to catch up and find their own footing, then flies ahead again.

**Key Brand Attribute:** Empowering agency, not creating dependency. This is a behavioral coaching model, not just a mask workshop topic.

#### 2. Technical & Visual Architecture

##### Domain Strategy ("The Fork in the Road")
- **Primary Hub:** soulcultivationnow.com (Main domain - integrated approach)
- **Potential Secondary:** scottsherman.com (Professional/Academic face for future expansion)
- **Architecture:** A "Fork in the Road" Landing Page
  - **Left Path:** Professional/Academic (Social work, Research, "The Material Path")
  - **Right Path:** Shamanic/Spiritual (Rituals, Energy, "The Soul Path")
  - **Middle Path (The Bridge):** Integrated Soul Cultivation - The recommended entry point

##### Branding Aesthetics & Visual Identity
- **Vibe:** "Mendocino County Hippie Hillbilly" meets "High-Concept Spirituality"
- **Geography:** "The Atmospheric River" ⭐ GOLD NUGGET #4 (Copywriting Swipe)
  - Ground the brand in the specific hydro-geography of Mendocino/Redwood Valley
  - Use regional weather patterns as metaphors for emotional/spiritual flow

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary:** Teal, Green, Blue (Ocean, Wind, Nature) 
- **Accent:** Lavender (Healing)
- **Support:** Cream, Sand tones for warmth

**Key Imagery:**
- **Raven & Phoenix:** Tattoo motif symbolizing the cycle of death (skeleton) and rebirth (feathers) crossing at the spine
- **Toroidal Energy:** Donuts/Spheres of energy flowing in and out (the flow of the universe)
- **Totems:** 
  - Hummingbird (Vibration, Magic, Transformation)
  - Blue Heron (Omen, Healing, Peace)
  - Flicker (Guide, Vision, Trail Guide model)
  - Egret (Grounding, Nourishment)
  - Wind Eagle (Memory, Storytelling)

**Copywriting Swipes from Audio:** ⭐ GOLD NUGGET #4
- "The Atmospheric River" (geographic anchor)
- "Rock in my pocket" (merchandising opportunity - send clients a grounding stone)
- "You hired a handyman, you got a Shaman"
- "We aren't painters, we're flippers" (reframing failure)

##### Tech Stack
- **Host:** Vercel.
- **Lead Magnet:** Custom Dagara Numerology Quiz.
- **Hardware Status:**
  - **Risk:** Secondary computer is a ~10-year-old MacBook Air. Will need upgrading for heavy AI workloads.
  - **Asset:** iPhone 15 Pro (Excellent for recording content).

#### 3. The "Lead Magnet": Dagara Numerology Quiz
This is the primary engine for capturing emails.

##### The Logic (Base 5 System):
##### Tier 1: Free / Awareness (The Content Machine)
- **Social Media:** Short-form video (Reels/TikTok) featuring Scott performing "Shamanic Personas" (The Stoic Heron vs. The Hyper Hummingbird)
- **Blog Series: "The 12 Elders"** ⭐ GOLD NUGGET #1
  - **The Ready-Made Content Calendar:** Scott has visited 12 specific elders throughout his journey
  - **Structure:** One story per month featuring an Elder, their specific lesson, and modern application
  - **Cadence:** Monthly blog posts + newsletter content for 1 year of consistent publishing
  - **Purpose:** Authority building, SEO content, email nurture material
  - **Also repurposing:** "Humble Psychotherapy" archives
- **Audio:** "Healing Songs" (Scott humming melodies, AI generating ambient backing tracks)
| 2 or 7 | FIRE | The Flicker | Vision, Ancestors, Passion, Dreaming. |
| 1 or 6 | WATER | The Blue Heron | Healing, Peace, Reconciliation, Cleansing. |
| 0 or 5 | EARTH | The Egret | Nourishment, Home, Grounding, Mothering. |
| 4 or 9 | MINERAL | The Wind Eagle | Storytelling, Memory, Communication, Bones. |
| 3 or 8 | NATURE | The Hummingbird | Magic, Transformation, Shapeshifting. |

##### User Experience:
1. **Input:** User enters Birth Year.
2. **Processing:** Animation of a spinning Toroidal Field.
3. **Result:** "You are a [Element] Person." (e.g., "You are Mineral.")
4. **The Hook:** Displays a brief reading of their strengths.
5. **The Gate:** "To find out your Spirit Bird and how to balance your specific energy, enter your email."

#### 4. Product Ladder & Revenue Model

##### Tier 1: Free / Awareness (The Content Machine)
- **Social Media:** Short-form video (Reels/TikTok) featuring Scott performing "Shamanic Personas" (The Stoic Heron vs. The Hyper Hummingbird).
- **Blog:** Repurposing "Humble Psychotherapy" archives.
- **Audio:** "Healing Songs" (Scott humming melodies, AI generating ambient backing tracks).

##### Tier 2: Mid-Ticket / Passive (Digital Products)
- **The Book:** "Seven Steps" (Working title). AI to assist in editing/rewriting the existing manuscript.
- **The "DIY" Course:** "Soul Cultivation: Reclaiming Agency in the Age of AI."
  - **Production:** AI ingest of Scott's "scattered" tapes/writings -> structured into modules -> AI Voice clone (optional) or re-recorded by Scott.
  - **Course Syllabus:**
    1. **The Foundation (3 Hearts):** Aligning Head (Logic), Heart (Emotion), and Gut (Intuition). Diagnostic: If Head says yes but Gut says no = Friction.
    2. **The Map (5 Elements):** Deep dive into the Dagara elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Mineral, Nature).
    3. **The Energy Body (Toroidal Matrix):** Clearing blockages ("knots") in the flow.
##### Tier 3: High-Ticket / Active Services
- **1-on-1 Coaching:** "Shamanic Vision Psychotherapy" (Using the Trail Guide/Flicker method)
- **Live Rituals:** Water cleansing down by the river; Grief rituals
- **Mask Making Workshops:** The "Flicker Mask" (Light/Dark spiral) to teach leadership and flow
- **Space Clearing & Home Tuning (The Bridge Offer)** ⭐ GOLD NUGGET #3
  - **Current Status:** This is Scott's ACTIVE bridge income (Manual Labor → Energy Work)
  - **The Pitch:** "You hired a handyman, you got a Shaman"
  - **The Service:** Scott enters a home for physical repairs (bookshelves, painting, lighting) but upgrades the service to energetic clearing
#### 5. Core Marketing Stories (Content Pillars)
**These are IP assets to be used in emails, sales pages, and videos.**

1. **The Malidoma Somé Lineage (Authority):** Surviving the "belly of the beast" (Jesuit school) to return to the soul. Bridges modern trauma and ancient healing.
2. **The Blue Heron (Omens/Confirmation):** The bird asking "What are you doing down here?" Proves the universe speaks to us.
3. **The Hummingbird God (Vibration):** The beak in the hibiscus. "Healing is Nectar."
4. **The Two Crystals (Law of Attraction):** Finding matching crystals years apart in Glastonbury and Mt. Shasta. "What you seek is seeking you."
5. **The Flicker Mask (Flow/Group Energy):** Stopping the drum and spinning the group. Demonstrates mastery of group energy dynamics.
6. **The $5 Lightbulb (Practical Magic):** Curing migraines with a cheap color-changing bulb. You don't need expensive tools, just intention.
7. **The Apartment Flipper (Reframing Failure):** "We aren't painters, we're flippers." A mistake is an opportunity.
8. **The Rock in the Pocket (Physical Anchor):** ⭐ GOLD NUGGET #4 - Scott always carries a rock as a grounding technique. **Merchandising opportunity:** Send clients a specific "grounding stone" with course/coaching purchases.
  - **Concept:** Scott enters a home to fix physical problems (bookshelves, lighting) but uses the time to fix energetic problems (lighting color temperature for migraines, flow of furniture). Bridges his manual labor with his spiritual expertise.

#### 5. Core Marketing Stories (Content Pillars)
Use these narratives to sell specific concepts.

1. **The Malidoma Somé Story (Authority):** Surviving the "belly of the beast" (Jesuit school) and returning to the soul. Bridges modern trauma and ancient healing.
2. **The Blue Heron (Omens):** The bird asking "What are you doing down here?" Proves the universe speaks to us.
##### For Samuel (Developer/Consultant):

2. **The Quiz:** Code the Dagara Base 5 logic into the lead magnet form with toroidal animation
3. **Ingest:** Feed "Seven Steps" manuscript and raw audio into NotebookLM to generate Course Workbook
4. **Voice Cloning:** Capture high-quality sample of Scott's voice for AI narration testing
5. **12 Elders Blog System:** Set up blog infrastructure for monthly elder story publication

##### For Scott (Client):
1. **The Archive:** Dig out the physical box of tapes and business cards
2. **The Manuscript:** Send the "Seven Steps" draft to Samuel
3. **Housing:** Complete move to Walnut Village
4. **Hardware Check:** The 10-year-old MacBook Air is a bottleneck - plan for upgrade or use cloud-based AI tools

### Phase 4: Immediate Next Steps (Right Now)

#### Action Plan:
1. **Create GitHub repo** (3 min)
2. **Clone reference repos** (5 min)
3. **Initialize Next.js project** (10 min)
4. **Copy base components** (20 min)
5. **Build Dagara quiz logic** (30 min)
6. **Deploy to Vercel** (10 min)

**Total Time to MVP: ~90 minutes**

### Critical Decisions & Recommendations

#### ✅ APPROVED DECISIONS (Based on Reference Analysis):
1. **Use Airtable** - Proven in signups.ukiahumc.org, excellent for non-technical client
2. **Vercel hosting** - Zero-config deployment, perfect for Next.js
3. **Modal-based signup flows** - High conversion, used successfully in reference sites
4. **Email validation patterns** - Copy exact regex from signups repo
5. **Color system** - Adapt mendolaborcoop's approach with Soul Cultivation palette

#### ⚠️ RECOMMENDATIONS TO DISCUSS:
1. **Domain Strategy**: Should we launch on `scottsherman.com` first or go straight to `soulcultivation.life`?
   - **My Recommendation**: Start with `scottsherman.com/quiz` for professional credibility, redirect to spiritual domain later
   
2. **Quiz Email Gate**: Should we require email BEFORE showing results or AFTER teaser?
   - **My Recommendation**: Show element + teaser, gate full reading (higher conversion based on signups patterns)
   
3. **Content Prioritization**: Build course pages first or story pages?
   - **My Recommendation**: Stories first (free content builds trust), course second (requires trust to sell)

4. **Hardware for Scott**: MacBook Air (10 years old) may struggle with heavy AI workloads
   - **My Recommendation**: Use cloud-based AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Descript) rather than local processing

#### 🚨 RISK MITIGATION:
1. **"Scattered tapes/writings"** - Need systematic digitization plan
   - **Solution**: Use iPhone 15 Pro to record/photograph, upload to cloud storage
   
2. **Voice cloning** - Requires high-quality audio samples
   - **Solution**: Record 10-15 minute clean audio session specifically for cloning
   
3. **Course structure** - Manuscript may need significant editing
   - **Solution**: Use AI (Claude/ChatGPT) to structure, then Scott reviews/edits

### Budget & Resource Estimates

#### Monthly Operating Costs:
```
Domain Registration: $24/year (2 domains)
Vercel Pro: $20/month (optional, starts free)
Airtable: $0-20/month (free tier likely sufficient)
Email Service: $0-15/month (Resend free tier = 3k emails/mo)
Stripe Fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (only on sales)
Cloud Storage: $5/month (Backblaze or similar)

TOTAL: ~$40-60/month at launch
```

#### Development Time:
```
Phase 1 (MVP): 15-20 hours
Phase 2 (Fork Landing): 10-15 hours  
Phase 3 (Content): 20-25 hours
Phase 4 (E-commerce): 25-30 hours

TOTAL: 70-90 hours for complete build
```

#### Scott's Time Investment:
```
Content Creation: 15-20 hours (recording stories, writing)
Course Recording: 10-15 hours (7 modules)
Voice Clone Sample: 30 minutes
Testing & Feedback: 5-10 hours

TOTAL: 30-45 hours over 4-6 weeks
```
